  I'm an engineer & researcher who is excited about robots and creating technology that feels like magic.

  I'm currently exploring problems in human-robot interaction as a master's student at Stanford University.
  Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I conducted human-AI interaction research with
  <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/" target="_blank">Anca Dragan</a> and 
  spent summers working on perception at
  <a href="https://everydayrobots.com/" target="_blank">Everyday Robots</a> and
  <a href="https://corporate.ford.com/operations/locations/silicon-valley.html" target="_blank">Ford Greenfield Labs</a>.

  When I'm not doing the above, you can often find me 
  <a href="/carillon">playing carillon</a>, 
  <a href="https://goodreads.com/michelllepan" target="_blank">chasing the end of my reading list</a>, 
  or doing New York Times crosswords with friends :)
