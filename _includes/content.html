  Hi! I'm a fourth-year at UC Berkeley studying computer science and learning how to build intelligent, human-centered technology. 
  I'm exploring AI and robotics with an interest in improving the way machines understand and interact with the world around them.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I'm working on algorithmic HRI research at the
  <a href="https://interact.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">InterACT lab<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a> 
  and teaching as an undergraduate student instructor for 
  <a href="https://www.eecs70.org/" target="_blank">CS 70<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a>.
  I also tinker with machine learning as part of the wonderful community at 
  <a href="https://launchpad.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Launchpad<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a>.
</p>

<p>
  In the past, I was an intern at
  <a href="https://everydayrobots.com/" target="_blank">Everyday Robots<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a>, 
  where I worked on vision & language models for zero-shot object detection and played with robots in my free time. 
  Before that, my time was spent across various adventures in technology for autonomous vehicles and social good.

  Hi! I'm an engineer and researcher who is excited about robots and creating technology that feels like magic.

  I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, where I worked on human-AI interaction research at the
  <a href="https://interact.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">InterACT lab<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a>
  and tinkered with machine learning as part of the wonderful community at 
  <a href="https://launchpad.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Launchpad<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a>.
  I also taught as a student instructor for 
  <a href="https://www.eecs70.org/" target="_blank">CS 70<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a>
  and played the

  Previously, I spent summers working with vision-language models on the perception team at
  <a href="https://everydayrobots.com/" target="_blank">Everyday Robots<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a>
  and developing sensor fusion algorithms for L3 autonomy at
  <a href="https://corporate.ford.com/operations/locations/silicon-valley.html" target="_blank">Ford Greenfield Labs<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a>.
