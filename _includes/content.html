  Hi! I'm a third-year at UC Berkeley studying computer science and learning how to build intelligent, human-centered technology. 
  I'm exploring AI and robotics with an interest in improving the way machines understand and interact with the world around them.

<p>
  Currently, I'm working on research at the
  <a href="https://interact.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">InterACT lab<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a> 
  and teaching as an undergraduate student instructor for 
  <a href="https://www.eecs70.org/" target="_blank">CS 70<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a>.
  I also tinker with and teach machine learning with the wonderful community at 
  <a href="https://launchpad.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Launchpad<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a>.

  In the past, I was an intern at
  <a href="https://everydayrobots.com/" target="_blank">Everyday Robots<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a>, 
  where I worked on vision & language models for zero-shot object detection and played with robots in my free time. 
  Before that, my time was spent across various adventures in technology for autonomous vehicles and social good.

  When I get the chance, I love to

  and do New York Times crosswords with friends :)
