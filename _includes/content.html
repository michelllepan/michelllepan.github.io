  I'm an engineer & researcher who is excited about robots and creating technology that feels like magic.

  I'm currently exploring problems in human-robot interaction as a master's student at Stanford University.
  Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I conducted human-AI interaction research with
  <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/" target="_blank">Anca Dragan</a> and 
  spent summers working on perception at

  These days, I'm exploring problems in human-robot interaction as a master's student at Stanford University.
  I recently built a multi-robot flocking experience at the
  <a href="https://src.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Robotics Center</a>, and am currently working on an interactive robot exhibit at the
  <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/" target="_blank">Exploratorium</a>.

  Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I conducted human-AI interaction research under
  <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/" target="_blank">Anca Dragan</a>, tinkered with machine learning at
  <a href="https://launchpad.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Launchpad</a>, and taught
  <a href="https://www.eecs70.org/" target="_blank">Discrete Math & Probability</a>.
  I also spent summers on the perception teams at
  <a href="https://everydayrobots.com/" target="_blank">Everyday Robots</a> and

  When I'm not behind a screen, you can often find me

  or doing New York Times crosswords with friends :)
