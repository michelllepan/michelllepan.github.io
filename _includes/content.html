<p>Hi! I'm a third-year at UC Berkeley studying computer science and learning how to build intelligent, human-centered technology. 
  I'm currently exploring AI and robotics with an interest in improving the way machines understand and interact with the world around them.</p>

<p>I spend time building ML projects at <a href="https://launchpad.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Launchpad<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a> 
  and teaching as an undergraduate student instructor for <a href="https://www.eecs70.org/" target="_blank">CS 70<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a>.
  I recently finished up an internship at <a href="https://everydayrobots.com/" target="_blank">Everyday Robots<img src="images/arrow.svg"/></a>, where I
  worked on vision + language models for zero-shot object detection and played with robots in my free time.</p>
